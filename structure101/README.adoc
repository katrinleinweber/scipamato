http://structure101.com/[Structure 101] is an agile _architecture developement environment_ that let's the software team organize their code base. [from their website]

The friendly people from Structure101 have kindly provided a free license for their excellent product to me in the context of SciPaMaTo as an open-source-project. Many thanks for that!!

I am currently using

* http://structure101.com/help/java/studio/[Structure101 Studio]
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7292-structure101-for-java[Structure101 Plugin for IntelliJ]
* http://2018.structure101.com/products/structure101-developer-overview/[Structure101 Workspace] for IntelliJ

mainly to

* get and keep the project (mostly) acyclic
* visualisation and documentation
* inspect and browse the project with architectural focus

and I'm just scratching the surface of the potential of their tools.
