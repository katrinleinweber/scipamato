All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

== Format and Versioning Scheme

The format is based on http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog].

The versioning scheme in the pre-1.0.0 versions is _not_ adhering to http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning].

Given a version number 0.ITERATION.RELEASE, we're incrementing

. ITERATION version matching the project iteration
. RELEASE version with every release within the given iteration.

TIP: E.g. release 0.5.6 is the 6th release in iteration number 5.


I will most probably switch to semantic versioning after having reached release 1.0.0.

NOTE: References to user stories are in the form Iteration/Story-Number.
