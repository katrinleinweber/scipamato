Heart position was determined in relation to the planning target volume (PTV) in 225 fractions in which daily low-dose CBCT images were compared with planning CT images. In addition, the position of the left lung apex and diaphragm was measured to evaluate the success of the DIBH.\nRESULTS: The median shift of the heart was 1\u2009mm to the left, 1\u2009mm superiorly and 0\u2009mm in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction during the treatment course when compared to the PTV position in planning CT. Based on these movements, an AP margin of 4\u2009mm, a lateral (LR) margin of 3\u2009mm, and a superior-inferior (SI) margin of 5\u2009mm should be added to the heart contour to ensure avoiding the heart when planning treatment. The distance between the left lung apex and diaphragm, applied as a surrogate for lung volume, was 2mm (median) smaller during the CBCT acquisitions than during the planning CT acquisition. The correlation coefficient between the surrogate of lung volume and the distance between the heart and PTV was r\u2009=\u2009.46 in the AP, r\u2009=\u2009.72 in the LR and r\u2009=\u2009.79 in the SI directions.\nCONCLUSION: Residual variation was observed in the position of the heart in comparison to PTV, even with a visually guided DIBH technique.

However, few studies have examined effects of ultrafine particles in a pediatric population. Our primary objective was to examine the effects of ambient concentrations of ultrafine particles on asthma exacerbation among urban children and determine whether consistent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids could attenuate these effects. We also explored the relationship between asthma exacerbation and ambient concentrations of accumulation mode particles, fine particles (\u22642.5 micrograms [\u03bcm]; PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. We hypothesized that increased 1-7 day concentrations of ultrafine particles and other pollutants would be associated with increases in the relative odds of an asthma exacerbation, but that this increase in risk would be attenuated among children receiving school-based corticosteroid therapy.\nMETHODS: We conducted a pilot study using data from 3 to 10 year-old children participating in the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial. Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we estimated the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit treated with prednisone (n=96 visits among 74 children) associated with increased pollutant concentrations in the previous 7 days. We re-ran these analyses separately for children receiving medications through the school-based intervention and children in a usual care control group.\nRESULTS: Interquartile range increases in ultrafine particles and carbon monoxide concentrations in the previous 7 days were associated with increases in the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit, with the largest increases observed for 4-day mean ultrafine particles (interquartile range=2088p/cm(3); OR=1.27; 95% CI=0.90-1.79) and 7-day mean carbon monoxide (interquartile range=0.17ppm; OR=1.63; 95% CI=1.03-2.59).

We observed no such associations with accumulation mode particles, black carbon, fine particles (\u22642.5\u03bcm), or sulfur dioxide.

Ambient exposures were measured at regional air monitoring stations. Seasonal average traffic-related exposures (PM2.5, ultrafine particles, NOx, and CO) were estimated near subjects'' geocoded residences for 6-month warm and cool seasonal periods, using dispersion models based on local traffic within 500 m radii. Associations were tested in case-crossover conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature and humidity. We assessed effect modification by seasonal residential traffic-related air pollution exposures above and below median dispersion-modeled exposures. Secondary analyses considered effect modification by traffic exposures within race/ethnicity and insurance group strata.\nRESULTS: Asthma morbidity was positively associated with daily ambient O3 and PM2.5 in warm seasons and with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 in cool seasons. Associations with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 were stronger among subjects living at residences with above-median traffic-related exposures, especially in cool seasons. Secondary analyses showed no consistent differences in association, and 95% confidence intervals were wide, indicating a lack of precision for estimating these highly stratified associations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Associations of asthma with ambient air pollution were enhanced among subjects living in homes with high traffic-related air pollution.

Children exposed to PM are more likely to develop respiratory infections and asthma. Although PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources, vehicle exhaust rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be a dominant contributor to the PM2.5 and PM0.1 fractions and has been implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).\nOBJECTIVES: Current studies of ambient PM are confounded by the variable nature of PM, so we utilized a previously characterized ethylene-combusted premixed flame particles (PFP) with consistent and reproducible physiochemical properties and 1) measured the oxidative potential of PFP compared to ambient PM, 2) determined the ability of PFPs to generate oxidative stress and activate the transcription factor using in vitro and ex vivo models, and 3) we correlated these responses with antioxidant enzyme expression in vivo.\nMETHODS: We compared oxidative stress response (HMOX1) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and PRDX6) expression in vivo by performing a time-course study in 7-day old neonatal and young adult rats exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to 22.4 \u03bcg/m3 PFPs.\nRESULTS: We showed that PFP is a potent ROS generator that induces oxidative stress and activates Nrf2. Induction of the oxidative stress responsive enzyme HMOX1 in vitro was mediated through Nrf2 activation and was variably upregulated in both ages. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme expression had age and lung compartment variations post exposure. Of particular interest was SOD1, which had mRNA and protein upregulation in adult parenchyma, but lacked a similar response in neonates.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PFPs are effective ROS generators, comparable to urban ambient PM2.5, that induce oxidative stress in neonatal and adult rat lungs. PFPs upregulate a select set of antioxidant enzymes in young adult animals, that are unaffected in neonates.

The association between incident wheezing symptoms and air pollution on the concurrent and previous 4 days was estimated by a logistic regression model (generalised estimating equation) controlling for temperature, season, gender, age, exposure to smoking and paternal history of asthma.\nRESULTS: Significant positive associations were found between concentrations of PM(10), NO(2), NO(x), CO and wheezing symptoms in infants (aged 0-1 year) with a delay of 3-4 days. Only the traffic-related gases (NO(2), NO(x)) showed significant effects throughout the 3 years of life, albeit attenuating after the age of 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Air pollution related to traffic is significantly associated with triggering of wheezing symptoms in the first 3 years of life.'), NULL, 1, TIMESTAMP '2017-04-27 15:03:06.095', 4, TIMESTAMP '2017-04-27 15:03:06.095', 4, 72);

The ultrafine fraction of particulate air pollution is of particular interest because of its increased ability to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs. We reviewed the literature, and to date findings suggest that ultrafine particles (UFPs) may play an important role in triggering asthma symptoms. Furthermore, we believe that indoor UFP exposures may be particularly important because people spend the majority of their time indoors where sources of these contaminants are often present. While several epidemiological studies have examined the respiratory effects of ambient UFP exposures, the relationship between indoor UFP exposures and childhood asthma has yet to be examined in clinical or epidemiological studies. However, the portable instrumentation necessary to conduct such investigations is increasingly available, and we expect that this issue will be addressed in the near future. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a general review of UFP toxicity as related to childhood asthma in order to draw attention to a potentially important public health concern.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A number of indoor sources of ultrafine particles (UFPs) have been identified, but the health effects of indoor UFP exposures remain largely unexplored. The potential respiratory effects of such exposures seem most concerning because these particles are known to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs. Subsequently, indoor UFP exposures may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals. This paper provides a review of UFP toxicity as related to childhood asthma, and to date evidence suggests that further investigation into the respiratory effects of indoor UFP exposures is warranted.'), NULL, 1, TIMESTAMP '2017-04-27 15:03:06.119', 4, TIMESTAMP '2017-04-27 15:03:06.119', 4, 75),

No change common to all sites where asthma has increased throughout the world has been identified, suggesting that this ''epidemic'' phenomenon is likely due to multiple factors. The following have been most discussed: exposure to indoor and outdoor allergens, modification of the patterns of respiratory infections, decreasing trends of physical activity, evolution in the make-up of environmental irritants, including tobacco smoke and urban air toxicants. In this review, we point out the role of exposure to air pollutants, in addition to and in combination with other asthma enhancers or precipitators. Whereas concentrations of the ''classical'' air quality indicators (SO2, CO) have more or less steadily decreased, asthma prevalence augmented in developed countries during the same period. However, the nature of the air pollution mix has deeply evolved, and should also be considered. Ambient air concentrations of industrial and house heating combustion sources of pollutants in the city have substantially decreased, but by contrast the concentrations of various ultrafine particles have increased. Now, there is in vitro and in vivo evidence that exposure to urban air particles, and particularly to diesel exhausts, elicits chronic oxidative stress and repeated inflammatory responses, so that they may enhance allergic inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. Several epidemiological studies suggested an association between traffic density close to places of children''s residence and prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and more specifically of asthma or allergic rhinitis symptoms in them.
